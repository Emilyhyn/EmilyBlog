                <p>Dear Sir/Madam,</p>
                <p>I recent graduate from the University of Melbourne with Master degree in IT.</p>
                <p>Last year I worked for an IT company in Melbourne to develop an online community portal and interactive platform (Link) by using PHP5. This working experience taught me a lot about LAMP. I use MySQL as the database and use phpmyadmin to manage it. I also used javascript, Ajax, Bootstrap, and HTML5 for front-end develop.</p>
                <p>I developed a system that tried to predict the result of 2015 UK election for my research project. I designed a web which dynamically showed the results of the data analysis. Python, CouchDB, Ajax, Bootstrap, and HTML5 are used in this project.</p>
                <p>During my undergraduate degree, I developed a travel website, which allowed users to login, register, book hotels and airplane flights, search scenery information, etc. This project allowed me to apply JSP, javascript, MySQL, and HTML. I also gained a deep understanding of MVC through this project. In the last year of my postgraduate degree, I used Ruby on Rails to complete two small projects and obtained more knowledge of MVC.</p>
                <p>After I graduated, the interest of web development also drive me to learn Laravel and AngularJS.There is an in-processing project in my GitHub(Link). It is a social network built with Laravel and Bootstrap.</p>
                <p>The heavy study load in my studies at the University of Melbourne has taught me to be well-organised and cope well with multiple commitments and a fast pace. I have rich experience in teamwork through my involvement in a number of university team project, and successfully cooperated with team members. I like to learn new technologies and can get familiar with a new thing quickly.</p>
                <p>I am not just a developer, however. The experience of volunteer, waitress and salesman in Melbourne taught me to communicate effectively with customers and provide good customer service in English. Additionally, some of my elective subjects are about how to combine IT well with a clientâ€™s business process.</p>
                <p>I am looking for a job as a PHP developer or web developer. If you have any position that may suitable for me, please send me an E-mail: yannih@student.unimelb.edu.au</p>
                <p>Thank you for reading!</p>
                <p>Sincerely yours,</p>
                <p><strong>Yanni Huang</strong></p>
